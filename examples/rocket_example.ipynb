    "# Prepare raster files by clipped and aligned to a master for Deep Learning, every weekend.\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how you can use Buteo together with Rocketry to schedule the processing of geospatial data. </br> The example does the following:\n",
    "1. Reads the raster content of a folder.\n",
    "2. Clips all the rasters to a target in memory (Can be vector, raster).\n",
    "3. Aligns all the resulting rasters in memory.\n",
    "4. Combines all the rasters into a single numpy array and saves it to disc as \"latest.npz\".\n",
    "5. Conducts all of the above step every Saturday afternoon after 16:00."
